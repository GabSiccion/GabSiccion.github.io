It improves students' knowledge. It gives an opportunity to experience a course. Most of the time, students have an idea or a list of what careers are suitable for them to choose. But unfortunately, most of the students do not possess the information or any idea about their target career and base their idea of it on subjects that they learn in school (Nyamwange, 2016). According to Yusran et al. (2021), knowing your skills, abilities, and talents, are central elements to the earliest career development fields. </p> <p> To address this lack of course exploration problem, the researchers proposed this study to create and develop CourseExplorer. A web-based software for Information Technology and Computer Science Course Program Exploration. </p> <a class="btn btn-success" href="https://tinyurl.com/Course-Explorer-Manuscript">Link to Chapter I-III Manuscript</a> </div> <h2>The Researchers</h2> <div class="person-card-container"> <div class="person-card"> <div class="person-body"> <p class="person-name">Riz Angel Veran</p> <ul> <li>Born in: Silang, Cavite</li> <li>Lives in: Dasmarinas, Cavite</li> <li> Hobbies: reading, watching documentaries, listenting to KPOP </li> <li>Dream: Reading</li> </ul> <div> Contacts <ul> <li>vrf0360@dlsud.edu.ph</li> <li>+63 09167790308</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="person-card"> <div class="person-card-body"> <p class="person-name">Gabriel Noel V.

Web Development has too many tools, and I'm still confused about which to use. </p> <div> Contacts <ul> <li>sgv133@dlsud.edu.ph</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body></html>
